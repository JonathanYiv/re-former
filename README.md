# Re-former Project

The goal of this project is to create forms in Rails using HTML, `form_tag`, and `form_for`.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

Not any.

## Post-Project Thoughts

I've taken in a lot of information about Rails and the difficulty going forward appears to be linking all the concepts together.
